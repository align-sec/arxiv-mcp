Implement an MCP server that will query arXiv. It will have a find_papers tool that will accept the values laid out in the schema specified in CLIENT.md. It should work in tandem with the implemented server. 

It will parse the results from the arXiv API call and return them to the client as a JSON object. Again ensure that it will work with the existing client functionality. 

The arXIV API reference can be found here: https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.html#_query_interface
